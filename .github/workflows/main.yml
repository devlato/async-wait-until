Since we are not creating a new file, there is no code to provide in this section.

However, based on the analysis of the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file, we can make the following modifications to fix the issue:

1. Check if there are any syntax errors in the YAML file. Fix any syntax errors if found.
2. Verify that the workflow triggers are correctly configured. Ensure that the correct events or schedules are specified for triggering the workflow.
3. Check if the required environment variables are properly defined and accessible within the workflow.
4. Review the steps and actions defined in the workflow. Ensure that they are correctly configured and have the necessary inputs and outputs.
5. Check if any required dependencies or tools are missing. Install or configure them as needed.
6. Validate the workflow configuration against the GitHub Actions documentation and best practices.
